Visualization of Results
========================

Finding the best model to deploy for a task at hand is a semi-automated
process. The data scientist runs a set of experiments in parallel, visualizes
comparative results, based on which the next set of experiments are planned.
Syne Tune does not only allow you to
`run many experiments in parallel <../benchmarking/README.html>`__, but also
provides tooling to rapidly create customized visualization in order to gain
insights for the next steps, or to present final results to clients. This
tutorial provides an overview of visualization facilities.

.. note::
   In order to run the code in this tutorial, you need to have
   `installed Syne Tune from source <../../getting_started.html#installation>`__.
   Also, make sure to have installed the ``blackbox-repository``
   `dependencies <../faq.html#what-are-the-different-installations-options-supported>`__.

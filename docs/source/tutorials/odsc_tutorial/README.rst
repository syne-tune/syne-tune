Distributed Hyperparameter Tuning: Finding the Right Model can be Fast and Fun
==============================================================================

These sections are part of a tutorial given at the Open Data Science Conference
Europe in June 2023. They provide hands-on examples for distributed
hyperparameter tuning, as well as links to further details for self-teaching.

.. note::
   The code used in this tutorial is contained in the
   `Syne Tune sources <../../getting_started.html#installation>`__, it is not
   installed by ``pip``. You can obtain this code by installing Syne Tune from
   source, but the only code that is needed is in
   :mod:`benchmarking.nursery.odsc_tutorial`.
   You also need have access to AWS SageMaker, and work through
   `these setups <../../faq.html#how-can-i-run-on-aws-and-sagemaker>`__.

    Variant of :class:`SubsampleMultiFidelityStateConverter`, which has the same
    goal, but does subsampling in a different way. The current default for most
    GP-based multi-fidelity algorithms (e.g., MOBSTER, Hyper-Tune) is to use
    observations only at geometrically spaced rung levels (such as 1, 3, 9, ...),
    and :class:`SubsampleMultiFidelityStateConverter` makes sense.

    But for some (e.g., DyHPO), observations are recorded at all (or linearly
    spaced) resource levels, so there is much more data for trials which progressed
    further. Here, we do the state conversion in two steps, always stopping the
    process once the target size ``max_size`` is reached. We assume a geometric
    rung level spacing, given by ``grace_period`` and ``reduction_factor``, only
    for the purpose of state conversion. In the first step, we sparsify the
    observations. If each rung level :math:`r_k`` defines a bucket
    :math:`B_k = r_{k-1} + 1, \dots, r_k`, each trial should have at most one
    observation in each bucket. Sparsification is done top down. If the result of
    this first step is still larger than ``max_size``, we continue with subsampling
    as in :class:`SubsampleMultiFidelityStateConverter`.

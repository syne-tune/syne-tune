    Outputs an order of the items in the provided array such that the items are spaced well. This
    means that after choosing a seed item, the next item is chosen to be the farthest from the seed
    item. The third item is then chosen to maximize the distance to the existing points and so on.

        The items to sparsify where N is the number of items and D their dimensionality.

        The index of the dimension which to use to choose the seed item. If ``None``, an item is
        chosen at random, otherwise the item with the lowest value in the specified dimension is
        used.

    """
    Special case of :class:`SynchronousHyperbandBracketManager` to manage DEHB
    brackets (type :class:`DifferentialEvolutionHyperbandBracket`).

    In DEHB, the list of brackets is determined by the first one and the number
    of brackets. Also, later brackets have less total budget, because the size
    of a rung is determined by its level, independent of the bracket. This is
    different to what is done in synchronous Hyperband, where the rungs of
    later brackets have larger sizes, so the total budget of each bracket is
    the same.

    We also need additional methods to access trial_id's in specific rungs, as
    well as entries of the top lists for completed rungs. This is because DEHB
    controls the creation of new configurations at higher rungs, while
    synchronous Hyperband relies on automatic promotion from lower rungs.

    This test check the behavior of the wait_trial_completion_when_stopping parametr of the tuner.

    In this scenario, starting the tuner will start n_workes (1) workers,
    each aiming to evaluate the objective for 0.2s (100 steps of 0.02s) given a set of params.

    In case the tuner does not wait until worker completion (wait_trial_completion_when_stopping=False)
    the jobs will be stopped after the stopping criterion is fulfilled (walltime reachig 0.1s).
    This means all worker jobs will be aborted and and with Status.stopped

    In case the tuner does wait until worker completion (wait_trial_completion_when_stopping=True)
    the jobs will not be stopped after the stopping criterion is fulfilled (walltime reachig 0.1s).
    They will run until completion 0.1s later (full 0.2s passed) and then conclude naturally with Status.compled
